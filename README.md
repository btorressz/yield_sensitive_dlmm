# # Yield-Sensitive DLMM - (yield_sensitive_dlmm)



## ðŸš€ Overview

yield_sensitive_dlmm implements a yieldâ€‘sensitive dynamicâ€‘liquidity market maker (DLMM) with an onâ€‘chain limit orderbook. The program dynamically computes concentratedâ€‘liquidity bands (price buckets) that adapt to yield signals and spot price, supports LP deposits/withdrawals, onâ€‘chain orderbook matching, governance, and keeper bounties.
This is a proof-of-concept developed in Solana Playground for research purposes.  Yield-Sensitive DLMM dynamically computes concentrated-liquidity bands based on yield signals and spot price, and includes an on-chain limit orderbook for hybrid routing and matching.
